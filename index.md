### Ilia Timofeev
_Software engineer: Ruby on Rails, JS, Clojure, ClojureScript_

I started my professional path with industrial automation, but after a while I realised that it was not my thing.
I studied Ruby on Rails on my own and moved to St. Petersburg and found my first job here. Soon it became necessary to deal with front-end - I got acquainted with React. Then I met less popular technologies like Elm and Clojure/ClojureScript.
As a result, I can call myself a full-stack engineer.
I'm trying to keep up with IT news: I listen to podcasts and read books.
